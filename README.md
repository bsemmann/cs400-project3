# ProjectThree
Team Name: FF

Project Name: Map of Wisconsin

Proposal Link: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1k8RkO8vj5_2nVgCzUTewbou-H5lzxDVPJDNLxkbpofA/edit?usp=sharing

## Short Description:
Our group intends to create a map of Wisconsin and navigate a user from one city to another city in Wisconsin. The application that we are developing takes two cities as input from the user and shows him the shortest possible route between them and how quickly the user can reach his destination depending on his mode of transportation. This application can be used by tourists or any person who is new to Wisconsin for navigation between cities.
